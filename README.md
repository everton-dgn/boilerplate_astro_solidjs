# :memo: About the Project

This application is a boilerplate for complex and large systems, especially those that need to scale with security and code quality.

We sought to achieve three pillars: readability, reusability, and refactorability.

In the construction of the UI, the Atomic Design structure was chosen, organizing the global components into atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates.

In addition to being constantly updated, this project was configured in the smallest details to serve as a basis for professional projects that require standardized and easy-to-maintain code architecture and design.
